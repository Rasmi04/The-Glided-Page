📖 The Gilded Page
An aesthetic "Girly Boutique" book discovery platform using Bootstrap 5 and 3D CSS transforms

📝 Project Reflection
1. Achievement Process
Concept: Developed a "3D Library" theme to move beyond standard grids.

Remixing: Combined Bootstrap's Navbar, Hero, and Card components. Customized the Card component with a Hardcover Spine effect using CSS borders.

Optimization: Moved metadata (titles/authors) below the covers to ensure 100% readability.

Synergy: Maintained a Champagne Pink & Rose Gold palette across all pages for brand consistency.

2. Tools & Transparency
Framework: Bootstrap 5.3 (CDN).

AI Tool: Gemini (used for 3D tilt logic and refining CSS shapes).

Imagery: Sourced from Pexels and Unsplash.

3. Learning Journey
Mastered the use of custom CSS properties like clip-path and perspective to elevate standard Bootstrap blocks. Learned that high-end UI requires a balance between "aesthetic" and "usability."

4. Time Taken
Total Time: 1.5 Days (~14 hours).
